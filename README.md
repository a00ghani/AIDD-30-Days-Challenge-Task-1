# AIDD 30 DAYS CHALLENGE - TASK 1

# What Does AI-Driven Development Means To You?
# ANSWER
For me, AI-Driven Development is like a big change in the way we work.I have always believed in working smart,not just working hard,and AI makes that possible.Instead of spending hours doing small tasks now I can focus on the real idea behind a project and let AI help with the technical load.It feels like having an assistant who supports me while I plan and create.

# How Do You See The Future Of Human-AI Collaboration In Software Development?
# ANSWER
I think the future of software development will be teamwork between humans and AI.AI will handle repetitive and boring tasks,and we will guide it with creativity and decision-making.I imagine a time where building something big will not feel stressful but exciting and fast.I am really happy to be learning this now,because the people who learn to work with AI will lead the future,not follow it
